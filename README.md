# furiousKart - A Level NEA project


It was scraped together in a few months and was a really fun project to work on. There are LOADs of bugs and none working bits, however it is still a rather fun game to download and play with your friends.  


# Download
simply download the "furiousKart download" folder and run the exe.  

Run a multiplayer server by just clicking "multipalyer" when in game and click start when all players are in game  

i think the game has like 8 max player limit til it creates a new server, and theres no actual way to create and find servers with passwords etc etc. It will simply connect you to the closest server.  
If i ever decide to "fix" or update the game, that'll probably be the first thing i change. For now its a semi okay game to mess abt in!
