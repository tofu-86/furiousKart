This is my A level Computer science NEA project

It was scraped together in a few months and was a really fun project to work on. There are LOADs of bugs and none working bits, however it is still a rather fun game to download and play with your friends. 
You'll need to compile it in unity, however multiplayer should be working for up to 8 players.
